# ADR-0010 — Namespace Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Rebels.Temporal is a domain-focused library dedicated to temporal processing: timestamp matching, temporal relations, and interval operations.  
The internal folder structure of the repository is intentionally modular (Matching/Pairs, Matching/Groups, Intervals, Windows, etc.), but end users of the library should not need to import multiple namespaces.

A clean and ergonomic API should be discoverable with a single `using` statement.

## Decision
All public types of the library will be exposed under a single flat namespace: namespace Rebels.Temporal;

Internal folder structure does not dictate namespaces and is only for repository organization.

## Consequences
- Users need only `using Rebels.Temporal;` to access the full public API.
- IntelliSense navigation becomes simple and predictable.
- Internal modularity does not leak into the API surface.
- Future modules can be added without introducing additional namespaces.
