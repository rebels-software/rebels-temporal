# ADR-0012 — Partial Class Architecture for TimestampMatcher

## Status
Accepted

## Context
`TimestampMatcher` is a core component responsible for multiple match strategies:
- one-to-one pair matching,
- one-to-many group matching,
- match operations with time windows,
- match operations with tolerance,
- visitor-based zero-allocation operations.

A single-file implementation would be too large and difficult to maintain.

## Decision
The `TimestampMatcher` class will be implemented as a `partial` class, split across separated files each representing functionality.


All parts share the same namespace (`Rebels.Temporal`).

## Consequences
- Modular and maintainable code organization.
- A single public entry point remains (`TimestampMatcher`).
- New match strategies can be added simply by creating additional partials.
- Internal complexity is isolated while API remains clean.
